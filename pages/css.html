    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <br />

    <div class="row flex-wrap">
      <div class="snippetcard">
        <p>{}</p>
        <p>the curly bracets are used too put your css inbetween.</p>
        <p>an example is .class {(css goes here)}</p>
      </div>

      <div class="snippetcard">
        <p>class, id, content</p>
        <p>putting a class item in css should always start with "." then the class name</p>
        <p>putting a id item in css should always start with "#" then the id name</p>
        <p>you can paste base elements and change them for example p {}</p>
        <p>they would look like this</p>
        <pre>
.class {
  (css)
}
#id {
  (css)
}
(html tag) {
  (css)
}
      </pre
        >
        <p>
          the class name doesnt matter same with id but it needs too be written exactly the same as
          in the html file. its also recomended too name it something so its easily findable in the
          css file, so something that relates too its function
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="snippetcard">
        <p>*</p>
        <p>this is an all tag. it will affect all the elements in your html</p>
      </div>

      <div class="snippetcard">
        <p>the diffrent messurments</p>
        <p>you have px, %, auto, null, 0, none, rem, em, ch,</p>

        <p>px is the pixels 1px is only one pixel</p>
        <p>
          % is a prosantage of a thing. if you use 80% on width you will use 80% of the page size or
          if you use it on text you will use 80% of the text-font-size for your site
        </p>
        <p>
          auto will make it try too take everything and try too center it. its a better 100% for
          width and so on
        </p>
        <p>
          null, 0 and none. all of these is the same just diffrents ways of writing it it basicly
          means nothing. so if used on margin it would be no margin
        </p>
        <p>Rem goes too the root number</p>
        <p>em</p>
        <p>ch this is one character lenght</p>
      </div>
    </div>

      </div>

      <div class="snippetcard">
        <p>background-color:</p>
        <p>

      <div class="snippetcard">
        <p>margin:</p>
        <p>
          margin creates a space outside of the item. margin can also be added a spesific side.
          -left, -right, -top, -bottom. if you write margin-top: you would only change the top
          margin
        </p>
        <p>you can also use shorthands like:</p>
        <p>margin: 10px(all axis);</p>
        <p>margin: 10px(top and bottom) 5px(left and right); margin: 10px(top)</p>

      </div>
      <div class="snippetcard">
        <p>padding</p>
        <p>
